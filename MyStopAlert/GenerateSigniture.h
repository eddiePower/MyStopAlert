//   This class is used to generate the signiture needed to get data from
//   the PTV api, it uses the full url as input and breaks that down into
//   a base url, developerID, developer key to generate the signiture that is
//   appended to the url required.  It does this by using the SHA1 encryption
//   methods from the CommonCrypto/CommonHMAC.h library. This was addapted from the
//   PTV API read me document examples.
